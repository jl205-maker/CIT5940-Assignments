# Part 1:
## Are Alicia and Lloyd both wrong, or perhaps both right? Is only one of them correct? Why?


# Part 2:
## What are the worst case (Big O) and best case (Big Ω) times for snippets C and D?


## When evaluating with VisualVM, does one of the snippets run faster than the other? In what situations? Why do you think this is the case?


# Part 3:
## Before you make any changes, explain whether you think a LinkedList or an ArrayList makes more sense in this instance. Which do you think will be faster? Why?


## When evaluating with VisualVM, is the LinkedList version Suho wrote, or your ArrayList version faster? Does this change when the list size is small versus when it is very large?


## If you ignore queue creation times, does that affect which ticket processor version is faster?


## Write a paragraph or two in the style of a technical report (think about – how would I write this professionally if I needed to explain my findings to my manager?).
Your report should answer the following questions:
* What did you learn from this experience?
* Which implementation do you suggest should be used? Are there certain situations that might call for the other approach?
* How does the theoretical time complexity compare with your findings?







# Part 4
## What is the worst case (Big O) and best case (Big Ω) time for Javier's algorithm? What are the worst case (Big O) and best case (Big Ω) space use?


## Write a paragraph or two in the style of a technical report (think about – how would I write this professionally if I needed to explain my findings to my manager?). 
Your report should answer the following questions:
* Which of the two algorithms is more efficient in time and space (in terms of Big O)
    * What about in actual runtime and space (using the profiler)
* Which implementation do you suggest should be used? Are there certain situations that might call for the other approach?
